	<h1>Welcome to the #DataCreativities glossary of terms!</h1>
	<p>On this site you will fond a glossary of terms commonly used by the #DataCreativities team. This glossary is expressed in two ways: as an <a href="https://kristalspreadborough.github.io/ZoomCircle2/interactive/">Interactive Glossary</a>, and as a <a href="https://kristalspreadborough.github.io/ZoomCircle2/text/">Text Glossary page.</a>
			Both have the same information, but offer different ways to engage with the content. Please use the suggested citations when refering to the glossary. </p>
